### HOW TO SET UP:

NOTE: CMU Graphics currently on supports Python 3.9 - 3.13. If you have python 3.14, you will have to install an earlier version.

1. Install [Desktop CMU Graphics](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop).
2. Unzip the folder, move *touhou_minus_1.py* next to the *cmu_graphics* folder, and run in IDLE.
3. Have fun!

### CONTROLS:

**To move:** Use arrow keys (or W, A, S, and D if you prefer.).

**To Shoot:** Hold Z (or J, if you chose W, A, S, and D). 

**Focus Mode(optional):** Hold X (or K, if you chose W, A, S, and D) to slow your movement speed and view your hitbox.

### GOAL:

Don't get hit by any projectiles, and defeat the evil eye!
